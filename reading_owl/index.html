        <h2>What and Why?</h2>
        <p>The purpose of the program is to provide users with an intelligent and interactive chat-based information assistant (not chat-based yet). Leveraging GPT models, the program aims to enhance the user's ability to retrieve accurate and relevant information across a wide range of topics.
            The project originated from a desire to try out LLM APIs to build something I'd personally like to use. And with rampant misinformation around us all, Reading Owl seemed like a useful tool.

         <p>Key Features and Goals </p>   
            
        <p> 1. Diverse Knowledge Base: The program taps into extensive knowledge repositories, enabling users to ask questions on various subjects and receive informative responses.</p>   
            
        <p> 2.Lateral Reading Assistance: Designed to aid users in lateral reading tasks, the assistant generates insightful questions that encourage users to explore diverse perspectives and sources.</p>
            
        <p> 3. Summarization Capabilities: The program can summarize information from multiple sources, providing concise and coherent answers to user queries.</p>
            
        <p> How It Benefits Users:</p>
            
        <p> Efficient Information Retrieval: Users can quickly obtain information without the need for extensive searches, streamlining the research process.</p>
            
        <p> Promotes Critical Thinking: By generating insightful questions, the program promotes critical thinking and encourages users to consider multiple viewpoints.</p>
            
        <p> Lateral Reading Support: Facilitates lateral reading tasks by summarizing relevant information and providing questions that prompt users to explore further.</p>
            
        <p> User-Friendly Interface: The chat-based interaction makes the program accessible to a broad audience, irrespective of technical expertise.</p>
            
        <p> Time-Saving: Users can save time by receiving concise summaries and relevant questions, avoiding the need to sift through lengthy documents.</p>

        <p><strong>Program Workflow Overview: Chat-Based Information Assistant</strong>

            Our chat-based information assistant operates through a streamlined pipeline that integrates advanced natural language processing (NLP) models to provide users with accurate and relevant information. The pipeline encompasses three key stages: Bing Search, Question Generation, and Summarization.
            
            1. Bing Search:
               - Purpose: Initiates the information retrieval process by querying the Bing Search API to obtain relevant web pages.
               - Implementation:
                 <code>
                    def bing_search(query, top_n=3):
                     # Code for querying Bing Search API and extracting relevant web pages
                     # ...
                     for result in search_results["webPages"]["value"]:
                     result_response = requests.get(result["url"])
                     try:
                         soup = BeautifulSoup(result_response.content, "html.parser")
                         text = soup.find("body").get_text()
                         clean_text = ""
                         for line in text.split("\n"):
                             clean_line = line.strip()
                             if len(clean_line.split(" ")) > 3:
                                 clean_text += f"{clean_line}\n"
                     #...
                        return return_list
                
                    </code>
               - How It Works: Utilizes the Bing Search API to fetch search results based on user queries, retrieving a list of relevant URLs.
            
            2. Question Generation:
               - Purpose: Generates insightful questions related to the retrieved information to encourage lateral reading and critical thinking.
               - Implementation:
                 <code>
                    def generate_questions(input_text: str, provider='openai'):
                     # Code for calling OpenAI APIs to generate questions based on input text
                     messages = [
                     {
                         "role": "system",
                         "content": "You are an informative and helpful assistant designed to assist users in the lateral reading task."
                         "Your goal is to analyze a given segment of...
                     },
                     {
                         "role": "user",
                         "content": f"Text: {input_text}\n------\nCarefully choose...,
                     },
             
                     # ...
                        return questions
                 </code>
               - How It Works: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-based model to generate a set of questions, fostering engagement and exploration of diverse perspectives.
            
            3. Summarization:
               - Purpose: Summarizes information from the relevant web pages to provide users with concise and coherent answers.
               - Implementation:
                 <code>
                    def summarize(question: str, documents: List[str], provider='openai'):
                     # Code for summarizing information from web pages to answer user questions
                     concatenated_input =


               - How It Works: Takes user-generated questions and the content of relevant web pages, employing ChatGPT to produce a short, informative summary.</p>

        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p> To understand the applicaiton of the program lets look at a simple example. To run tests yourself refer to the README linked above. </p>

        <p>We first start with a statement to input. The program works best if its a statement and not a question.</p>    
        <code>
            def run_temporary():
                input_text = "Giovanni Gentile is relevant in studying democracy and free society."
        </code>
        <p>
            The program will go through the pipeline we highlighted above and provide you with results in the terminal. For our example, the answer will look something like this.
